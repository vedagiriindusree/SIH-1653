## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1. Role-Based Simulation Platform Develop a web platform enabling real-time, role-based simulations between selectors (recruiters) and applicants (candidates) for training and assessment.

2. Custom Scenario Creation Allow selectors to design and deploy industry-specific scenarios such as interviews, group discussions, or problem-solving tasks.

3. Live Interaction Tools Integrate chat, video conferencing, whiteboards, and file sharing for seamless selector-applicant communication during simulations.

4. Performance Evaluation System Include scoring rubrics, automatic tracking of responses, and manual feedback input to assess applicant performance fairly and consistently.

5. Analytics & Reporting Dashboard Provide detailed analytics for selectors to review applicant trends and for applicants to track personal growth over time.

6. Secure and Scalable Architecture Ensure data security with encrypted sessions and scalable architecture to support institutions or organizations of varying sizes.
